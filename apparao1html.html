     <p> <u>Non-Vegetarian Recipes-</u>  There are some of us for whom a good meal almost always means a meaty affair.
     With so many varied kinds of non-vegetarian dishes, one is sure to be bowled over with lip-smacking flavours. 
     Look within the Indian sub-continent and you have unique preparations using local regions of the region. Imagine biting into Malabar fish curry,
      Mangalore chicken curry, Goan masala prawns, Kosha Mangsho, butter chicken, Laal Maas, Amritsari fish and Rogan Josh to name a few. 
      Turning to International cuisines, there are many more dishes to add to the indulgence. Some of those dishes are so popular that you commonly
       find food fanatics dishing them out at the comfort of their kitchen. Fish and chips, steaks, barbecued pork ribs, grilled chicken,
        meatballs, - you name it! There is no end to the delectable non vegetarian dishes that you can enjoy to your heart's content. </p>

         lunch and dinner meals. They serve Indian food which is truly pocket-friendly. Try the Masala Dosa here and head to 25 Main Road, Tanah Rata,
